These are some code snippets that I need to type from time to time in the interactive console of the GAE dev environment

Remove the entire data store
-----
from app.models.entry import Entry

t=Entry().all().fetch(1000)
for tt in t:
  tt.delete()

Mark all entries as non-deleted
------
from app.models.entry import Entry
t=Entry().all().fetch(1000)
for tt in t:
  tt.deleted = False
  tt.put()
